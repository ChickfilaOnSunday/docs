# Welcome to HS Hackers: _Good Posts vs. Crap Posts_

(Based on "Welcome to Hacker News")

---

[HS Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PennAppsHS/) is a bit different
from other Facebook groups, so we'd appreciate it if you'd take a minute to
read this.

HSH is an experiment. As a rule, a community site that becomes popular will
decline in quality. Our hypothesis is that this is not inevitable—that by
making a conscious effort to resist decline, we can keep it from happening.

We don't know whether this hypothesis is correct, but it has held up for a
surprisingly long time already.

Essentially there are two rules here: don't post crap, and don't be rude in
comments. Both kinds will be deleted swiftly, and you if you continue to post
them, you might be banned from the group.

A crap post is one that wasn’t intended to genuinely add value to the
community. Posts on HSH don’t have to be about hacking, because good hackers
aren’t only interested in hacking, but they do have to something HS Hackers
would enjoy or find interesting. See the examples below for numerous examples
of each kind of post, and explanations for their classification.

The most important principle on HSH, though, is to make thoughtful comments.
Thoughtful in both senses: both civil and substantial.

Does your comment teach us anything? There are two ways to do that: by pointing
out some consideration that hadn't previously been mentioned, and by giving
more information about the topic, perhaps from personal experience. Whereas
comments like "LOL!" or worse still, "That's retarded!" teach us nothing.

Empty comments can be ok if they're positive. There's nothing wrong with
submitting a comment saying just "Thanks." What we especially discourage are
comments that are empty and negative—comments that are mere name-calling.

**Examples of crap posts:**

* “Anyone interested in helping me with a new startup, IM me!”
  * There are not nearly enough details. You shouldn’t keep these secret. (See:
    http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html)
  * What startup? What is your idea? What is the position? What is the
    location? What is the technology? What qualities are you looking for? Why
    should someone help you? What do you get out of it? Who’s involved?
* Why won’t my code work? <link to code>
  * This is not a tech support forum.
  * Your question is too vague. If you have a specific, technical question
    about why some specific code isn’t working how you’d expect, first try
    debugging yourself, then Googling, then debugging again, then Googling
    again, and THEN consider asking on HSH. Not before.
  * We’re not here to help you cheat on your APCS homework, or do your
    freelance work for you.
* How do I use GitHub Pages?
  * This is not a tech support forum.
* Can anyone help me with some JavaScript errors I’m getting? Thanks!
  * This is not a tech support forum.
* Has anyone used the Twitter API before? IM me!
  * Google it.
* Does someone have a free Namecheap coupon?
  * Ask in [HS Offers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HSOffers/).
* Yo, who watched House of Cards last night?
  * Even though many HS Hackers may watch that show, this group is not the
    place to discuss it.
* How do I become a coder?
  * TODO: Add specific resources for answering this question
* Can you help me hack someone’s account?
  * Absolutely not. We’re not those kinds of hackers.
* <picture of meme>
  * Memes can be acceptable content in comments, but don’t make a post about
    them, unless it’s accompanying an otherwise Good Post.
* Where can I download the latest episode of Silicon Valley for free?
  * Copyright infringement is unwanted in this group. Besides, a quick Google
    search would be much easier.
* Soooo umm…anyone taking AP Latin?
  * Post in your school’s group, not here.

**Examples of good posts (actual examples):**

NOTE: Just because a post is good, doesn’t mean a thread is good. If a thread
devolves into a flamewar, it might be deleted.

* Who’s going to PennApps? or Anyone going to the Thiel Summit in SF?
  * Finding a team/fellow HS Hackers going to hacker-related events is awesome!
* For the node.js guys out there, Grunt or Gulp?
  * Intelligent, constructive discussion about technology and tools is awesome,
    as long as it is just that — not a flamewar.
* Congrats to my friend Ryan for a great interview on Android Authority!
  Definitely a source of inspiration for all high schoolers looking into
  Computer Science! <link to article>
  * Awesome! Sharing press articles about you or fellow HS Hackers is
    definitely okay.
* Show HS Hackers: DIY Google Glass. I don't see too many hardware hacks out
  there, so thought it would be a great idea to expand a bit in that domain.
  Although I don't have too much experience with electronics, I managed to
  create a working prototype under 30 dollars (haha I'm too poor to buy one).
  This is only a proof of concept as well as a learning experience for myself
  and it turned out pretty okay so far. Hopefully I can find a better display
  and develop a decent interface around it in the near future...
  * Showing off projects/apps/tools you’ve made is AWESOME.
* What do you use for a to-do list/organizer? or What text editor do you use?
  * These are okay, because talking about tools is important. But don’t post a
    new one every week. The answers will likely be the same anyway.
* Hey everyone, register for HackBCA! [A hackathon]
  * Letting people know about hackathons is definitely awesome.
* Hey guys! On 5/14/14 Alex, Paul, Aakash and myself will be releasing the
  private beta of HackerBracket, a community for sharing hacks through video
  presentations. Video encoding + our hosting becomes pretty expensive at a base
  price of $50/month. I would really appreciate it if you support us by
  pre-ordering an early pro account for $10/year. Get it here:
  https://gumroad.com/l/hackerbracket
  * This was asked nicely, prices were disclosed up front, and it was made by
    community members. No harm here.
* So my friends (Harvard drop outs) built Fiveprep. It's a tool to help you
  study APUSH (pretty much quizup for apush). I know the test is coming up in
  less than a week so I hope you all get 5s! http://fiveprep.com/
  * This is is a technological tool for high schoolers. Awesome.
* Is Learn C the hard way a good resource for learning C?
  * Specific question, can cause good discussion.
* Does anyone know how I can get an AP computer science class at my high
  school?
  * Nuff said. (Also, talk to Zach Latta.)
* Hmm, I just received a DMCA takedown request for content in one of my GitHub
  repos. Anyone have experience dealing with these before?
* http://m.networkworld.com/community/blog/band-releases-album-linux-kernel-module
* Thanks so much to all you guys who helped me with the launch of 4 Snaps and
  who downloaded my game today on the first day! The app is now #1 in the US
  Top Word Games chart and 105 Overall charts! Thanks so much guys!!!!
